# Product Inventory Project

## Description
* The project is to implement warehouse software. This software holds articles. The articles contain an id, a name, and available stock. The warehouse software also has products, products are made of different articles. Products have a name,
  price, and a list of articles from which they are made from with a quantity. With the product id, we can create an order. If the order
  created successfully the software should change the articles stock amount and create an order record in the database

### Usage Reasons
#### Mongodb
* MongoDB has become one of the most wanted databases in the world because it makes it easy for developers to store, 
manage, and retrieve data when creating applications with most programming languages. MongoDB also makes it easy for developers 
to store structured or unstructured data.

#### Kotlin
* Fever bugs
  * If you code in Kotlin, the chances of making bugs are extremely less compared to other complex programming languages. 
  The reason is very simple and straight forward. Because it is easy to learn and only involves less code to accomplish the same thing, 
  the number of bugs will be also less. So, if you are a Kotlin programmer, the time you spend on fixing bugs will be extremely low compared 
  to other languages. Definitely a catch for experienced developers who frequently spend hours figuring out the source of a bug.
* Productivity Improvement
  * Because it is easy to learn and maintain, there is a huge productivity boost compared to Java and other programming languages
* Null-aware type system allows complete control over this aspect of JVM programming and prevents a lot of typical annoying mistakes.
* Inline arguments make String generation so much less painful, because you donâ€™t need to use either arcane formatting strings nor awkward concatenation.
* With default method argument, you don't need to create a bunch of constructors in every other case

#### MockK
* Easy to understand method coverages and returns
* Final result can be returned by specifying complete chain of calls. No need to mock each and every method output.
* Suppose offer is of different types and its return type is generic then `hint` will help to give a hint to mockk 
which version we actually are looking for
* A very exciting thing about Mockk is, objects can be mocked.

### Values
* Mongo DB is running on 27017 port.
* Inventory application is running on [8080](http://localhost:8080) port


### Containerizing and Deployment
* In this project we have 1 docker file and 1 docker compose file.
* Docker file includes maven download, maven build command and java jar file build
  * You also have an option for maven manual build.
* [Docker compose file](docker-compose.yml) includes 2 different images
* The first image is Mongo DB. Mongo DB image needs 2 different files.
  * [.env](.env) file includes mongo db version, container name and spring boot ports.
  * [inventory.js](inventory.js) file includes database user creation
* The second image is Inventory Application image created by the [DockerFile](Dockerfile)
  * Application image depends on Mongo DB instance. If the application gets an error, it will restart the application by itself
  * You can add another environment variable to environment tab. 
  You can use like an [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) element
* If you want to run this project on a docker container, you just need to run this command:
  ```bash 
    docker compose up -d
  ```

### Swagger
* After startup, you can access the Swagger documentation site with [this](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) URL

### Postman Collection Url
* After startup, you should import [this](src/main/resources/Inventory%20Collection.postman_collection.json) file to Postman Application.
  With these requests, you can successfully create products, articles and orders.

### Next Steps
* My next step would be adding more endpoints to control whole application. After endpoint enhanced, 
I would create nice UI/UX designed frontend side. It would be separated project and I would use React.js (```v1.1.0```)
* After creation process of frontend, I would create Authorization and Authentication part. we would be able to
  log in via Jwt bearer token as a result we would create data safety.(```v1.2.0```)
* Kubernetes, AWS integration and pipeline would be great for deployment. We can have automated deployment(```v2.0.0```)
